This is suposed to simulate a Red Box vending machine that on the outside only has a number pad and a credit card scanner

There is a second terminal inside the machine that only a tech can access by unlocking the front with a Key
for mantinance, restocking and changing out the library, the inner consold would have a full keyboard

This is just a repurposed Movie Store invintory project and is mostly copy and paste.

The only new thing is a simulated call out to varify the credit card.
